Tutorials for Python Package pymcmcstat
---------------------------------------
These tutorials are designed to accompany the Python package `pymcmcstat <https://github.com/prmiles/pymcmcstat/wiki>`_.  The "index.ipynb" file is a good place to start in order to figure out what each tutorial has to offer.

To work interactively with the example notebooks, launch them with Binder!

|binder|

URL: https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/prmiles/pymcmcstat_examples/master

Otherwise, view the tutorials with Jupyter nbviewer:

Additional Resources
--------------------
Feel free to checkout the documentation for `pymcmcstat <https://github.com/prmiles/pymcmcstat/wiki>`_ on `ReadTheDocs <https://pymcmcstat.readthedocs.io/en/latest/?badge=latest>`_.

Local Use
---------
Feel free to download the repository!  We recommend you use a `virtual environment <https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html>`_ for running these examples.  `Anaconda <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_ provides a nice interface for managing environments and installing Jupyter Notebooks.  Open a terminal for your environment, navigate to the downloaded repository and execute

::

    $ pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install all (or at least most) of the required packages for running these examples.  Obviously, to run the notebooks locally, you will also need to install `Jupyter Notebooks <https://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html>`_.
